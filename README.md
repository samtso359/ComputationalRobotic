The entire projects in the .tar file can be executed with Gazebo ROS after extraction

Project 2:
talker1.py (Assignment2/pqp_server/scripts/temp) is the source code for Piano Mover problem using PQP collision checking library and Probablistic Road Map(PRM) to create a path for the piano

talker.py (Assignment2/comprobfall2018-hw2/ackermann/ackermann_client/scripts) is source code for Ackermann bot to calculate and run on a path that is collision free using Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT)   
Both are also in the .tar file

Project 3: 
map1.py (comprobfall2018-hw3/turtlebot/turtlebot_ctrl/scripts) is the source code for Localization problem for turtlebot. Turtlebot is able to tell its location by generating numerous sample points on the map and match the correct location with the locations of the obstacles after some movements.
