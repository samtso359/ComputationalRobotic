The entire project in the .tar file can be executed with Gazebo ROS after extraction

talker1.py is the source code for Piano Mover problem using PQP collision checking library and Probablistic Road Map(PRM) to create a path for the piano
talker.py is source code for Ackermann bot to calculate and run on a path that is collision free using Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT)   
Both are also in the .tar file
